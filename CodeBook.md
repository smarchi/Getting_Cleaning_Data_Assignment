# Codebook for "feature_mean.txt" dataset

* `subject`: Value from 1 to 30. Represents an id for every person perfoming the different activities.

* `activity`: The activity performed by the subject, which can be laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs. They are denoted by the keywords `laying`, `sitting`, `standing`, `walking_downstairs` and `walking_downstairs`, respectively.

* Feature variables: Mean values of the selected features from the raw data. Every feature is contained in one column of the tidy dataset. The features considered are: `tBodyAcc[axis]_[func]`, `tGravity[axis]_[func]`, `tBodyAccJerk[axis]_[func]`, `tBodyGyro[axis]_[func]`, `tBodyGyroJerk[axis]_[func]`, `tBodyAccMag_[func]`, `tGravityAccMag_[func]`, `tBodyAccJerkMag_[func]`, `tBodyGyroMag_[func]`, `tBodyGyroJerkMag_[func]`, `fBodyAcc[axis]_[func]`, `fBodyAccJerk[axis]_[func]`, `fBodyGyro[axis]_[func]`, `fBodyAccMag_[func]`, `fBodyAccJerkMag_[func]`, `fBodyGyroMag_[func]`, `fBodyGyroJerkMag_[func]`. The `[axis]` part of each variable name can be X, Y or Z, one for every three dimensions axis. The `[func]` part can be `mean` or `std`, indicating if the variable is the mean or the standard deviation value, respectively, of the feature measured in the raw data. The total number of features considered in the tidy data is 66 and each one is located in a different column. Finally, the possible value for every feature is bounded within [-1,1]. Values are dimensionless.
